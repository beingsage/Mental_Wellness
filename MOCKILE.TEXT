1. Sentiment Analysis
Purpose: Analyze mood from journal entries or user input.
Data to Collect:

Journal Entries: Free-text input from users about their day, feelings, or thoughts.

Mood Ratings: Self-reported mood scores (e.g., on a scale of 1‚Äì10 or using emojis like üòä, üòê, üòî).

Contextual Data: Tags or labels for mood context (e.g., "work," "family," "health").

Example:

Journal Entry: ‚ÄúI had a tough day at work. My boss criticized my presentation, and I felt really stressed.‚Äù
